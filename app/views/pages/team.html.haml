    %p
      At OnPrem, we only hire the best and the brightest. But intelligence only accounts for so much - stellar personalities are also required. Each of us has a unique background and experiences that enables all of us to learn from each other and collectively elevate our level of work. One common bond that we all share is our passion for Media & Entertainment. While we're serious about our work, we also know how to have fun. 
    %p
      Everyone at OnPrem is also dedicated to advancing the company as a whole, which we do through our internal squads. Each team member belongs to at least one squad of his/her choosing and collaborates with others to carry out internal company initiatives. Squad members participate in Branding & Marketing, Professional Development, Company Strategy, and Team/Culture Management projects, among others. Our squad work is often just as fulfilling as our client work, as we all have the opportunity to help influence and shape the future of OnPrem.
